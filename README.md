🌐 MeaningOS – Semantic Network Specification v1

This repository contains MeaningOS (Language OS):
a system that separates the “meaning” of natural language from statistics, context, and surface expressions,
and preserves it as an immutable semantic structure (core + triple).

Meaning = the position a core_concept occupies within the network of meaning_triples

Words = human-facing labels stored as expr_node / expr_links

Common sense, trends, prohibition/permission = handled by evaluation layers (triple_evidence / triple_stats)

The 9-slot View (WHO / WHAT / WHY / HOW / WHERE / WHEN / OUTCOME / STATE + DISC)
is a dynamic rendering model and must not be stored

💡 Core Ideas (Super Summary)
1. Meaning is stored as triples (src, rel, dst)

Example:

core:knife.kitchen-001  
  -- core:use-purpose-001 -->  
core:cut.with_blade-001


meaning_triples are immutable: no deletion or overwriting
→ MeaningOS acts as a historical archive of meaning.

2. Words and meaning are completely separated

Words → expr_node / expr_links

Meaning → core_concept + meaning_triples

Dialects, eras, slang, deprecated terms → handled via expr_links.conditions_json

3. Conditions, Evidence, and Statistics are separated

conditions_json: contextual constraints under which a triple holds
(domain, region, era, language, freq, etc.)

triple_evidence: supporting/opposing evidence for a triple

triple_stats: evolving common-sense / frequency over time

4. Reverse triples are auto-generated by the OS

Input:
(A, core:material-001, B)
Generated automatically:
(B, core:material-for-001, A)

Conditions & polarity are copied → enables full-direction inference.

5. The 9-slot View is a rendering model, not stored data

Given a focused core, the system dynamically derives:
WHO / WHAT / WHY / HOW / WHERE / WHEN / OUTCOME / STATE / DISC
from relevant triples and conditions.

Saving the view would break consistency → logic only, no DB storage.

🚀 Recommended Implementation Priority

(Extracted from Appendix B)

Register core_concept / rel_concept + reverse generation

Implement meaning_triples with conditions_json

Implement expr_links (regional & orthographic differences)

Add triple_evidence (dictionary → human → corpus → AI)

Add triple_stats (low priority)

Implement 9-slot view (render-only)

🌱 Development Stages

A: Manual Input Stage – meaning constructed by hand (current status)

B: Semi-automatic from statistics / UD / dictionaries – short-term goal

C: Autonomous inference – OS proposes new core/triples

D: Scientific inference – meaning → reasoning → world modeling (long-term vision)

🤝 Contributions & Collaboration

The project is currently in the specification-design phase.

Feedback via Issues / Pull Requests is welcome.

Domain-specific triple examples (cooking, medicine, law, biology, etc.) are also appreciated.

Data structures are designed to map cleanly to CSV / JSON / relational DBs.
