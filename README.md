# MeaningOS
MeaningOS is a language-independent semantic operating system that stores immutable meaning as a structured graph of core concepts and triple relations. Expressions, evidence, and social usage remain changeable, while meaning itself forms an eternal, versioned knowledge layer for transparent reasoning.
