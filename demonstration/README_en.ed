Demonstration – Folder Overview

This directory contains the demonstration setup for the Mini Meaning OS (Language OS Prototype).
The project uses a split architecture to safely publish a public demo while keeping the internal logic, datasets, and reasoning engine private.

The goal is to transparently demonstrate the concept and behavior of the Language OS without exposing sensitive internal files or future expansion logic.

## 1. Hugging-Face-Spaces/

This folder contains all files related to the deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.

The project uses the recommended two-space structure:

### ① Public UI Space

This is the only part visible to the public.

Provides a simple Gradio-based demo interface.

Contains no internal logic or datasets.

Calls the Private Backend Space through gradio_client using a secure token.

HF_TOKEN authentication is handled through Hugging Face “Secrets” and is never included in the code.

The public sees only:

The interface

The question → answer demo

High-level behavior of the meaning system

Nothing else.

### ② Private Backend Space

Contains the entire Mini Meaning OS implementation

Meaning triples

Core concepts

Evidence tables

Question parsers

All reasoning and interpretation logic

And all internal CSV files / model structures

This Space is private and accessible only through an API call.

Why?

Because the internal meaning network is still under development and may contain:

Non-final structure

Experimental relations

Internal notes

Domain-specific placeholders

Evidence sources that should not yet be published

Future extensions that must be reviewed before release

By keeping the backend private, the project maintains:

Safety

Intellectual property protection

Reproducibility

Flexible future publishing strategies

## 2. Public-UI-Space/

A local mirror of the Hugging Face public UI source code.

This folder exists to:

Edit UI layout safely

Update descriptions or examples

Separate UI logic from the internal OS logic

Provide a clear boundary between “visible” and “hidden” parts of the project

This separation prevents accidental exposure of internal files.

## Why Split the Architecture?
✔ Full transparency for the concept

The conceptual design of the Language OS is meant to be open.

✔ Full protection for the data & logic

Meaning triples, domain structures, and semantic rules will grow in complexity and must be carefully reviewed before publication.

✔ Prevent accidental leakage

By physically separating UI and backend, nothing in the internal logic can leak through the demo.

✔ Flexible future governance

This architecture supports future models like:

Open-core

Partially public knowledge

Expert-reviewed contributions

Versioned releases of reasoning rules

Selective exposure per domain or per concept

✔ Higging Face Official Best Practice

Hugging Face recommends this structure for:

LLM inference servers

Proprietary models

API-gated demos

Research-proof systems

## Security Note: About HF_TOKEN

The only secret in this entire project is the HF_TOKEN used to authenticate the public UI when calling the private backend.

This token is stored securely in Hugging Face “Secrets”.

It does not appear anywhere in the code.

It cannot be viewed once entered.

This ensures that the entire rest of the project can remain fully public without risk.

## Summary

This structure ensures:

Component	Public?	Purpose
Public UI Space	✔ Yes	Demo interface only
Private Backend Space	✖ No	Meaning OS internal logic
HF_TOKEN	✖ No	Authentication credential
All other folders/files	✔ Yes	Safe to publish
## Purpose of this README

This document explains:

Why the folders are separated

Why the backend must remain private

What the public can access

What the internal OS contains

How the Hugging Face Spaces architecture works

Why this design is future-proof and safe

Anyone reviewing this repository can understand what is published and why, without exposing any sensitive logic.
